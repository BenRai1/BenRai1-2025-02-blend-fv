## Formal Verification Details

[TODO - Certora]

## How to reference bugs submitted to [the Code4rena audit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-blend) 
1. On [your `Findings` screen](https://code4rena.com/findings), locate the submission you want.
1. Right-click on the link and select `Copy link address`.
1. Paste the URL into the related Github issue on your private clone which describes the rule they have for the bug. The URL structure should look similar to this: `https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-02-blend-v2/submit?issue=BrJRfSTiHxX` 
   - Alternately, you can just include the UID at the end of the URL string (e.g. `BrJRfSTiHxX`).
